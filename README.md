# Spatial Data Science: The New Frontier in Analytics

## Use location to find patterns and tackle complex problems

Spatial data science allows analysts to extract deeper insight from data using a comprehensive set of analytical methods and spatial algorithms, including machine learning and deep learning techniques. This course explores the application of spatial data science to uncover hidden patterns and improve predictive modeling. You'll work with powerful analytical tools in Esri's ArcGIS software and learn how to integrate popular open data science packages into your analyses.

### Goals

- **Understand** how spatial data science helps uncover hidden patterns
- **Use** ArcGIS data engineering methods and visualization tools to prepare data for spatial analysis
- **Gain** hands-on experience performing suitability analysis, predictive modeling, space-time pattern mining, and object detection
- **Communicate** analysis results and insights using engaging and compelling ArcGIS StoryMaps
